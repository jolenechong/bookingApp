![Gif of booking submission](assets/submitBooking.gif)<br><br>

After the pandemic, 50% of employees who can work from home are allowed to return to the
workspace. Those who report to work onsite are encouraged to self-test via ART. <br>

BookingApp handles bookings so that staff of a company perform the following before returning to the office
- Perform ART and submit results
- Only when submitting a negative result, staff can book a slot before going down to the office.
- The booking will only go through if it doesnâ€™t exceed 50% of current staff count.<br><br>

User Process
1. Sign up/ Login with an email and password
2. View/Edit/Delete Current bookings with the home page
  - Swipe left to delete booking
  - Click to show a screen of the confirmed booking which will be used at the entrance of the office for proof of booking
  - Staff can edit bookings with a button at the top right but bookings can only be changes to a date within 7 days of when the booking was placed
3. Create New Bookings with the new booking page
  - Staff will enter the date they want to return to the office, ART test results and ART test image
  - New bookings can only be created if current staff count is below 50%
4. View availability and bookings by date with the calendar page


<br>


Assumptions
- Each staff can only create one booking for one day (hence no timeslots)
- Staff can only view upcoming bookings, not past bookings
- ART test results only stays valid for 7 days (staff can only book 7 days in advance)
- All staff will show proof of booking at the entrance of the building
- Bookings will only be accepted with a Negative ART Result
